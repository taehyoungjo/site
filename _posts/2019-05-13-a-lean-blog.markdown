I have a tendency to want to form fully conceived thoughts before I write. This is something I will actively be avoiding for my notes

This takes forever.

I need to want to write

I want to write only what will contribute to my learning

Eric Ries: The Lean Startup

Stanford professor

Mimumum viable product + Minimum viable effort

I will publish unfinished

I will go back and revise constantly

This prioritizes my learning.

I will make hypotheses as I learn things

Sharing my thoughts is important but ultimately I write for myself


## TLDR
* I want to be able to write with minimum viable effort
* The goal of notes is to learn (about the world and myself)
* My notes will be "lean": I'll regularly cut corners and publish unfinished work as long as I can successfully crystalize my thoughts
