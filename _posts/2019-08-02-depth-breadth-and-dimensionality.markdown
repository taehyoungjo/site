Something that makes me both irreconcilably sad and irrationally excited is the idea that in my lifetime, the universe of things I know I don’t know (“known unknowns”) will always expand faster than that of things I know I know (“known knowns”).

If information in the universe is infinite, this may as well be true for all of time and not just my lifetime.

Either way, my learning life is finite – inevitably I must make trade offs while learning. 

This thought experiment has real implications – in the grand context of things, right now, the only thing that I really know is that I want to know more. How I choose to shape my learning clearly will impact the things I do and the way I think.

One popular way of modeling information is with depth and breadth. That is, I can dedicate my time bringing myself closer to the frontier of one subject (where “known unknowns” meets “unknown unknowns”), or I can spread my time across many different subjects. This is often visualized by college admissions counselors in diagrams where different subjects extend outward in different directions from a central locus. Students are described as “well-rounded” or “pointy”, which is just another way of referring to the depth and breadth of accomplishment.

Maybe this is a sensible model when it comes to measuring high school accomplishment (probably not), but it seems implausible to model information in the same way. Information, for one, can be synthesized between domains. In fact, I would argue that most of the encroachments we’ve made on the “unknown unknown” territory as of late lie at the intersection of two or more domains. There is dimensionality to information. Even the idea of strict domains doesn’t really make sense either. For example, I don’t really know how to draw a discrete bound around everything that is philosophy. And for a lot of what we discover at the intersection of domains, we have a tendency to expand domain definitions in a way that makes it seem as if it always only belonged to one.

This also matters because hard problems often have solutions that exist near the “known unknown” - “unknown unknown” frontier. Paul Graham says that “If you're at the leading edge of a field that's changing fast, when you have a hunch that something is worth doing, you're more likely to be right.” I think conventionally, a lot of people imagine the leading edge of a field to be the tip of the “pointy” model of information. With this model, depth trumps breadth (something college blogs seem to agree with).

But if in fact information has dimensionality, it is probably better represented as a n-dimensional space where each discrete axis is a “domain” of information (or as close as you can get to a sensible idea of domain). Correspondingly, the “leading edge” is better described as a surface area of your information in that space. If that’s the case, breadth gives you a better shot at maximizing your frontiers, as long as you are actively synthesizing information between what people traditionally consider domains. This also means that it is a lot harder to pin down where the “leading edge” really is. There’s a solid chance that adding a layer of dimensionality to a traditional problem will reveal that the “leading edge” of an n-dimensional space is not as “leading” as that of an n+1 dimensional space. I find this reassuring (and more exciting!). There doesn’t have to be a unidirectional rat race to claim progress. And I think lots of people (myself included) will agree that learning many different things and seeing how they fit together is much more fun anyways.

Corollary and note to self: “multidimensional” and “one-dimensional” are better descriptors than “deep” and “broad”.
