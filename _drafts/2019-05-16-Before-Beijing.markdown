I have been learning Chinese for two semesters.

I had a vague intuition that learning Chinese would be useful

More recently, I have been whittling my intuition into insights

Chinese technology is important

Reframe China: Fast internet adoption, slow infrastruture, think Africa

What I want to learn:

Chinese modern history

What people want

What makes people happy

What people think about western technology

How I want to learn:

Bottoms-up approach: learning about real people's problems and thoughts on technology

Top-down approach: talking to investors and entrepreneurs

Hypotheses:

## TLDR
* Something
* Something else
