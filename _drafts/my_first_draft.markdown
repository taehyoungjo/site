I returned home after an eventful year at Yale last Wednesday. I reflect on my time [here](#)

Although I've escaped the routine of college life, I've admittedly set myself up for a just as regimented summer. I'll be in Korea for a short two weeks and then in Beijing for a much longer two months to study Chinese as a [Light Fellow](https://light.yale.edu/about) and learn more about the tech scene in East Asia. 

Routine can quickly become rut. To avoid this, I've decided to clearly outline my goals for the summer not only as a Fellow but also as a guest in Beijing and as an active learner in my other areas of interest. I'm hoping that this outline can be a reference point throughout the summer and a medium for reflection afterwards.

As a start, here are my goals for the summer:

1. *Developing foundations*
2. *Have fun!*

There are three dimensions to my goals: domain specific **skills** that develop depth, bigger picture **perspectives** that contextualize through breadth, and practical **projects** that tie the two together and make new inroads.
