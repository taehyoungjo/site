###### 眼见为实 (yǎn jiàn wéi shí): To believe in what can be seen

On Sunday, we committed ourselves to nine weeks of speaking only Chinese. As a second-year student in Chinese, I found myself no longer able to communicate and entertain most complex ideas or opinions. While I've felt frustrated at times, in a way, I've been liberated to focus more on my original goal and spend more time observing and less time interfering with how people here live.

I chose to come to Beijing (and to learn Chinese) because I wanted to intimately understand the people that drive this century's most interesting and important economy. In the first week of Harvard Beijing Academy, I've seen with my own eyes some of the most obvious features of Beijing life and how technology accomodates for the city's unique characteristics.
