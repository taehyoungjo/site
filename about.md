Welcome to my site! 

I’m Tae Hyoung Jo (조태형, 赵兑衡) 

I’m a Seoul born, Virginia raised, proud California resident that splits his time between asking big questions, building cool things, and enjoying college life with my friends!

Right now, I am a rising sophomore at Yale passionately curious about technologies, economies, and the people that drive them.
