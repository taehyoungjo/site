Welcome to my site!

My name is Tae Hyoung Jo. I love learning, mostly by building things for the Internet or by reading. I live in San Jose but I spend part of the year as a student at Yale studying CS, Economics, and East Asian Studies where I manage a student investment portfolio.

I believe in long-termism and the equal value of lives. Recently, I've been thinking a lot about grand narratives in history and technology's role in driving progress.

Some things I enjoyed building include a platform for organizing the best learning resources on the Internet over long periods of time, an extension for intuitive link saving (lists are underrated!), and an app that listens to police radio and maps live incidents.
